      "500g mascarpone",
      "20g cocoa powder"
    ],
    "preparation": "Start by brewing strong coffee, lightly sweetening it, and then let it cool.\nCarefully separate the eggs, placing the yolks and whites in separate bowls.\nWhisk the egg yolks until foamy, then gradually add the sugar and Amaretto. Stir the mixture well until it’s smooth.\n\nAdd the mascarpone to the yolk mixture and gently fold it in with a spoon or spatula until well combined.\nBe careful not to overmix, as this can make the cream too runny.\n\nIn a separate bowl, whip the egg whites, optionally with a pinch of salt, until stiff peaks form.\nCarefully fold the whipped egg whites into the mascarpone mixture. This creates a light and creamy tiramisu filling.\n\nDip the ladyfingers about one-third to halfway into the cold coffee, and place them on a plate with the soaked side facing down. Let them sit briefly.\nSpread a layer of the mascarpone cream in a suitable dish.\nArrange the soaked ladyfingers closely together on top of the cream layer.\nSpread another layer of mascarpone cream over the ladyfingers.\nAdd a second layer of soaked ladyfingers, then drizzle them with Amaretto.\n\nCover the tiramisu and refrigerate it overnight. This allows the flavors to develop and the tiramisu to set properly.\nJust before serving, sift cocoa powder evenly over the top of the tiramisu.\n\nTiramisu, the iconic Italian dessert, carries a rich history and an irresistible charm. Its origins lie in Northern Italy, likely in Veneto or Friuli Venezia Giulia, and its name, meaning 'pick me up,' is an invitation to indulge.\n\nThe preparation involves layers of ladyfingers soaked in strong coffee and Amaretto, combined with a velvety blend of mascarpone, sugar, and eggs. This balance of sweet, slightly bitter flavors, paired with hints of coffee and almond, creates a sensory delight.\n\nMaking tiramisu from scratch is both a culinary experience and a tribute to Italian tradition. It doesn’t require complex techniques, just quality ingredients and attention to detail. When served, the delightful aroma of coffee and mascarpone adds a touch of magic, while every bite offers a melody of flavor and texture.\n\nTreat yourself to the irresistible allure of tiramisu and savor a piece of Italy on your plate.\n\nPlease note: A portion contains around 320-350 calories, and this recipe uses raw eggs, which can carry a risk of salmonella. Consider using pasteurized eggs, especially for pregnant individuals, young children, or anyone with a weakened immune system.\n\nWe hope you enjoy every moment of this delectable dessert, crafted with love and meant to be shared. Buon appetito!",
